# Exploring OpenAI with LangChain

This is a proof of concept that demonstrates the integration of [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/overview) and [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/) to perform similarity search and question answering tasks based on a document file provided as input. This project showcases the capabilities of LangChain, a Node.js library that leverages OpenAI's language models for efficient language processing.
